# Introduction

Ada Wiki is a small library that provides a Wiki engine supporting several Wiki syntaxes.

The library allows to:

* Parse a wiki text such as Markdown, Mediawiki, Creole, PhpBB, Dotclear and Google Code,
* Parse HTML content in embedded wiki text,
* Filter out the wiki, HTML or text through customizable filters,
* Render the wiki text in HTML, text or another wiki format.

This document describes how to build the library and how you can use
the different features and integrate it in your own Ada application.
